(December 2023) This repository contains three games, one in each of the folders. These are made with a custom engine with the following dependencies on Ubuntu 20.04 for wsl, and an X Server (I used XMing) set up and running on Windows.
Ubuntu 20.04 dependencies:
	sudo apt-get install g++
	sudo apt-get install build-essentials
	sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
	sudo apt-get install build-essential
	sudo apt-get install x11-apps
	sudo apt-get install libzmq3-dev
	sudo apt-get install libnode-dev
To run, follow the readme.txt fines in each folder.
