Compilation: Compile with the make command (using the given makefile)
Execution: Run by calling the client with (./client) or the server with (./server)
    The server must be active for the client to connect. 8 clients can be connected at once, however they are unable to interact with eachother, so the game can be considered singleplayer

Controls:
    Left arrow: Move Left
    Right arrow: Move right
    Up arrow: Shoot
    S: Restart the game
    L: Hold to suspend the player in an inactive state and pause the game. This is just to test the scripting capabilities for event management
